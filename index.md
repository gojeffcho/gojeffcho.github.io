I am a Computing Science Specialization and Game Development Certificate student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta.  I am an undergraduate research assistant, Teaching Assistant for CMPUT 201 (Practical Programming Methodology), and Executive Producer for CMPUT 250 (Computers and Games).  My areas of research include Compilers and Static Analysis with [Prof. Karim Ali](http://karimali.ca/), Interactivity and Narratology in Games with [Prof. Astrid Ensslin](https://astridensslin.wordpress.com/), and Artificial Intelligence with [Prof. Michael Buro](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/michael-buro).

My passions include game design, leadership, teaching, and community-building.  I am a Game Designer, Producer, and Lead Developer with [TEAM JEFF](http://teamjeff.ca), and I love to volunteer with organizations like the [Awesome Foundation](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/) in my spare time.  I am also very interested in how rapidly evolving technologies affect our use and understanding of identity, ethics, privacy, security, and communications.  My other hobbies include homebrewing, music, cooking (particularly using sous vide or smoking techniques), video games, and marksmanship.
