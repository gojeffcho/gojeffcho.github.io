  Independent research examining whole-of-system analysis of games using unit interactions as the bases for building situational understanding and representations.  The foundations for this research and its utility in classifying and understanding games and unit interactions in games, particularly multiply-metaleptic games which defy traditional narratological or interactive taxonomy, were presented at HUCON '18 and DiHuCon '19.  Supervised by Dr. Astrid Ensslin.
