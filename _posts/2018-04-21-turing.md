  *\> turing* is a text adventure game set in the future where general artificial intelligence has become developed enough to threaten human employability.  You play as an employee at a firm where you are tasked with conducting pre-screening interview chats with candidates in order to determine whether or not they are AIs.  The game features a retro-futuristic command-line console interface, original soundtrack, and a colorful ensemble of human and AI characters.  Will you side with humans and try to prevent as many AIs from getting jobs as possible?  Or will you be sympathetic to AI rights and self-determination?

  Originally made for the course STS 350: Understanding Video Games, *> turing* was met with positive reception, including an exhibition at TELUS World of Science Edmonton Dark Matters 2018.  It was created by TEAM JEFF using a custom-built text adventure engine/interface in Ren'Py and is currently being remade to bring out its full potential as a game and narrative experience.  I am the Producer and Lead Developer on this project, with credit for design, writing, and sound.
