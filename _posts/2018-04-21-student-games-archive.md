  This is an initiative in two parts to archive and display standalone digital student works created at the University of Alberta as part of the Game Development Certificate.  The archival portion is in the works through the library and the website is currently under design and development.  The website will display students' games and information about them, and the members involved along with their roles, as well as other useful information related to game design, game development, and the certificate.
